					<h3>Fusion</h3>
					<img class="pull-left" src="./images/merge-icon.png" alt="Merge">
					<p>Taking Material Design to the big screen in a big way! We have created a robust Bootstrap-like framework using the core principles of Material Design. Taking them from the small screen to the big. We have created a beautiful fusion with the bold colours and smooth transitions of MaterialDesign with the robust and well-loved Bootstrap design and framework. Something familiar for all kinds of users means your website won’t be dreaded on a small screen or empty on a large one.</p>

					<h3>Elegance</h3>
					<img class="pull-left" src="./images/art-icon.png" alt="Art">
					<p>We believe that websites should be pleasing to look at and meld together, say goodbye to green-on-yellow colour schemes and hello to bold colours with a light background. Gone are the days when your main content is a box with a border and rounded corners, Materialstrap handles all the structure you need. Don’t rely on floats! Use our 6 column gridded layout to perfectly layout your design. We’ll do all the heavy stuff, download structure your basic page, adjust the colours, and off you go!</p>
